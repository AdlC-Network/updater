What it does \u00b6 This periodically checks your servers and plugins for updates and alerts you through Discord when when it finds a new version. You will be prompted to approve updates and are usually given links to the build/version's changelog. Once per hour it downloads any updates you have approved, then twice a day it will attempt to upload the downloads JARs. Before uploading, it checks each server's player count, and doesn't update unless and admin reacts to a Discord message to approve it. This it to avoid servers being restarted with lots of players online and when there isn't an admin around to fix it if there is an issue after updating. How it works \u00b6 Look at the code if you want to know exactly how it works. You can choose between PaperMC or the ServerJars API for your servers. Plugins can be sourced from GitHub Releases, a Jenkins build server, or SpigotMC. Limitations \u00b6 You can't update a plugin on some servers and not others (except if you have servers with different Minecraft versions, you could have multiple plugins from the same source). Installation & setup \u00b6 Installation .
